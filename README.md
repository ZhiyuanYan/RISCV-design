# RISCV-design
Some RISCV cores based on Verilog design, for SQED detection
 

1. mriscvcore ([link](https://github.com/onchipuis/mriscvcore))
     Not yet add QED module

2. RISCV-CPU ([link](https://github.com/georgetoader/RISCV-CPU))
     I am trying to add the QED module, there are some bugs need to be fixed. The folder "SQED" contains the core and the QED module that I try to insert.

3. Tang_E203_Mini ([link](https://github.com/Lichee-Pi/Tang_E203_Mini))
     There are many other modules that are not the the core. Still need more effort to remove other compoments.
